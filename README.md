# UEQ-S Implementation in a Python Notebook

This repository contains a Python Notebook implementing the Short User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ-S). The notebook calculates the UEQ-S scores for different aspects such as Pragmatic Quality, Hedonic Quality, and Overall Experience.

You can compare the results with the offical UEQ-S analysis tool in the repository or download it directly from:
