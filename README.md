# UEQ-S Implementation in a Python Notebook

This repository contains a Python Notebook implementing the Short User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ-S). The notebook calculates the UEQ-S scores for different aspects such as Pragmatic Quality, Hedonic Quality, and Overall Experience.

You can compare the results with the offical UEQ-S analysis tool in the repository or download it directly from:

## Results

The UEQ-S scores were calculated based on the responses to the survey. The scores were divided into the following categories:

- **Pragmatic Quality:** 0.903846
- **Hedonic Quality:** 0.519231
- **Overall Experience:** 0.711538

These values can be interpreted based on the UEQ's standard scoring system, with the scores ranging from -0.8 to 0.8, where negative values indicate negative feedback and positive values indicate positive feedback.

## Graphic Representation

The following bar chart represents the above scores with a gradient background, visually representing the transition between negative and positive feedback.
